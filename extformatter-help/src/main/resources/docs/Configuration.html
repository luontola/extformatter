            <p>This section will explain how you can start using <b>External Code Formatter</b> in your project.
                When the plugin has been enabled, it will transparently replace IDEA's built-in code formatter.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-image:url(../DefaultCSS/img/blue_romb_blt.png);">
                <li>You can reformat your code as before, by pressing <span class="shortcut">Ctrl+Alt+L</span>, or when
                    committing files to VCS.
                </li>
                <li>If the external code formatter does not support a file type, or you try to reformat a selected text,
                    the plugin will automatically fall back to using IDEA's built-in code formatter.
                </li>

            <p>You will need to have <b>Eclipse 3.2</b> or later installed to use the Eclipse code formatter from within
                IDEA. The Eclipse code formatter supports formatting only Java source code files. When reformatting code
                with it, Eclipse's startup banner will show up momentarily.</p>

            <p>In <b>External Code Formatter</b>'s project settings, choose the

            <p>You can use any code formatter which can be executed on the command line. Refer to the instructions of
                your code formatter to find out the right command line parameters. It is possible to configure more than
                one command, which will help <b>External Code Formatter</b> to reformat all files with as few formatter
                executions as possible.</p>

            <p>In <b>External Code Formatter</b>'s project settings, choose the
                <span class="ijControl">Use a custom code formatter</span> option and configure the following fields:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Supported file types</dt>
                <dd>A space separated list of file types which the code formatter should reformat. The wild card
                    <span class="ijControl">*</span> is supported. To reformat all files, enter
                    <span class="ijControl">*.*</span>. To reformat for example only Java and HTML files, enter
                    <span class="ijControl">*.java *.html *.htm</span>.

                <dt>Command for reformat one file</dt>
                <dd>A command which can be executed to reformat one file at a time. Even if no other commands are
                    specified, it is possible to let all the code reformatting to be done with this one command, but it
                    might be unduly slow. This command should contain the tag <span class="ijControl">%FILE%</span>
                    which will be replaced with the full path of the file being reformatted.
                </dd>

                <dt>Command for reformat many files</dt>
                <dd>A command which can be executed to reformat a list of files. <i>This command has the best performance</i>
                    and all code formatting can be done just with this command. If this command is specified, then there
                    is no need to specify the other commands. This command should contain the tag
                    <span class="ijControl">%FILES%</span> which will be replaced with a space separated list of the
                    full paths of the files being reformatted.

                <dt>Command for reformat directory</dt>
                <dd>A command which can be executed to reformat all supported files in a directory. Does not advance
                    into subdirectories. This command should contain the tag <span class="ijControl">%DIRECTORY%</span>
                    which will be replaced with the full path of the directory whose files are being reformatted.
                </dd>

                <dt>Command for reformat recursively</dt>
                <dd>A command which can be executed to reformat all supported files in a directory tree. Advances
                    recursively into all subdirectories. This command should contain the tag
                    <span class="ijControl">%DIRECTORY%</span> which will be replaced with the full path of the
                    parent directory whose files and subdirectories are being reformatted.
